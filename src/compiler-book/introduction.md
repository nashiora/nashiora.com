# Introduction

Even though this book discusses a reference programming language implementation,
Hibiku, the actual contents are not strictly tied to it. Most of the code
examples will come from the reference implementation, in part or in whole, to
aid explanations. Feel free to follow along with the Hibiku implementation, to
create your own compiler alongside this text or to use it purely as reference
material without a care for following along.
