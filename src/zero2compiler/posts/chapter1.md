# Introduction

I've been fascinated by programming languages for as long as I can recall knowing what they were,
and especially so after realizing they were more than just magic that already existed. As soon
as I learned someone *made* a programming language I dove head first into trying to make my own.
With zero knowledge of how compilers or interpreters worked, I booted up Roblox Studio and tried
to create a programming language in Lua. I didn't know what `void` meant, but it looked cool, so that
was my function declaration keyword.

Yeah, I didn't get very far.

That brief tangent is to say I remember what it was like to be desperate to make a programming language
without any know-how to get the job done. I've come a long way since then and much of the process is
second nature to me now, but I've never stopped looking for accessible learning materials. Admitedly,
compilers as a whole are not the most accessible topic, especially the closer you get to generating
actual executable code, but that doesn't mean they're impossible. I'm choosing to believe that not
enough people have truly decided to write easily accessible and beginner friendly articles or books
about compilers rather than accept that it's impossible.

That's the goal of this series of posts (if I stick with it, maybe I'll call it a "book"). I want to
share all I've learned about compilers, and interpreters, and do my best to make the experience
both approachable to beginners *and* a good reference material for those already more experienced.

## Why learn about compilers?

## How will this be organized?

## What steps will we take to implement the language?

- Front end: lexer, parser, any necessary analysis
- Interpreter: interpret whatever the front end produces
- Back end: implement a code generator for a few different targets probably

The Hibiku language
